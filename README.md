# Matrix-as-Graph

This is a mini project I wrote in the "Server Side Development" course. 

In the project we applied advanced principles in object-oriented development and design patterns (Strategy, Adapter).

The problem: 
given a binary matrix represented by a two-dimensional array. 
You should treat the matrix as a graph. 
Given a vertex in the graph, you need to find its connectivity element.
